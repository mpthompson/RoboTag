DirectShow BaseClasses Library
==============================

This directory contains the DirectShow base class library.  On the Windows 
platform, the robot vision applications interact with the internals of 
DirectShow to pull images from the video stream for vision processing.  This 
library assists in that process.

The DirectShow base class libary has been included in past versions of the 
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) as a sample library, but are 
included in source form only.  I've pulled them out of the SDK and included them 
here in our source code repository for easier management of this required code 
resource for the robot vision application.

Within the Microsoft Windows SDK, the base class library can usually be found at 
the following relative path:

(SDK samples root)\DirectShow\BaseClasses
